# Installing AMReXplorer

Build from source. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04, on macOS, and on WSL.

The build produces two programs:

- `amrexplorer` — the application. Opens plotfiles on the machine it runs on.
- `amrexplorer-server` — optional. Run it where the data lives, typically an HPC
  login node; `amrexplorer` starts it and talks to it through ssh.

## Requirements

CMake 3.25 or newer, a C++20 compiler (GCC or Clang recommended), and Qt 6.4 or
newer for the application. Check CMake first — enterprise distributions and HPC
login nodes often ship an older one:

```bash
cmake --version
```

## Dependencies

### Linux (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install g++ cmake ninja-build qt6-base-dev
```

### Linux (any distribution)

With [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack):

```bash
spack install qt-base
spack load qt-base
```

### macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install cmake ninja qt
```

### Windows

The recommended path for Windows is to use WSL2 with an Ubuntu distribution.
This has been tested by the developers on a Windows 11 machine. The documentation
for installing WSL2 on Windows with the default Ubuntu distribution is [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
After installing WSL2, the Linux (Ubuntu) instructions can be used unmodified.

Native Windows is covered only in continuous integration: MSVC 2022 with Qt 6.8, using
the `windows` preset. None of the developers uses Windows or has tested a build
on one, so there is no guidance here for it. Using WSL2 instead is strongly recommended.

### Optional

`ffmpeg` is needed only to encode animation exports (MP4):

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg   # Ubuntu
brew install ffmpeg       # macOS
```

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrex-codes/amrexplorer.git
cd amrexplorer
cmake --preset default -DAMREXPLORER_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build --preset default --parallel 4
```

Run it from the build tree without installing:

```bash
./build/src/qt/amrexplorer /path/to/plotfile     # Linux
open build/src/qt/amrexplorer.app                # macOS
```

## Install

```bash
cmake --install build
```

No `sudo` needed: this installs to `~/.local` on Linux and `~/Applications` on
macOS. On Linux the application lands at `~/.local/bin/amrexplorer`, and a
desktop entry puts it in your application menu. If `~/.local/bin` did not exist
before, log out and back in for it to be on your `PATH`.

Choose somewhere else with `--prefix`:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /opt/amrexplorer
```

## HPC systems

Build the server only, with a GNU toolchain:

```bash
module load gcc            # or gcc-native on a Cray system
module load cmake          # if the system cmake is older than 3.25
cmake --preset remote --fresh -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DAMREXPLORER_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build --preset remote --parallel 4
cmake --install build-remote
```

That installs one file, `~/.local/bin/amrexplorer-server`.

Use `--fresh` whenever you change the compiler; without it the configure fails
again with the same message and has to be run twice.

If your home directory is shared between machines, give each its own prefix so
one build does not overwrite another:

```bash
cmake --install build-remote --prefix ${HOME}/perlmutter
```

See the **[User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** for connecting the application to
this server over SSH.

## Next steps

See the **[AMReXplorer User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** for opening plotfiles,
navigating 2-D and 3-D data, selecting AMR levels, animation, export, and
troubleshooting. The same guide is bundled in the application under **Help >
User Guide...**.

Developers and packagers: see **[docs/building.md](docs/building.md)** for build
options, presets, the compiler matrix, and packaging an AppImage.

## Existing installations

AMReXplorer uses new application and settings identifiers. Preferences,
desktop entries, and icons created by previous releases are not migrated or
removed automatically; they can be left in place or removed manually.
