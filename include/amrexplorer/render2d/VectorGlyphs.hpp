// Legacy Amrvis vector field glyphs (AmrPicture::DrawVectorField). The
// longest plane side is partitioned into count segments, giving a sampling
// stride; one arrow is drawn per stride cell, anchored at the cell center
// (i + 0.5, j + 0.5) in plane pixel coordinates (x = column, y = row,
// row 0 at the bottom of the plane, so a positive v component points toward
// increasing y). Arrow components are scaled by arrowMax / maxSpeed, where
// maxSpeed is the maximum speed over the plane and arrowMax = 1.25 *
// (longestSide / count), so the fastest sample gets an arrow of length
// arrowMax; the sampling stride is the integer floor of longestSide / count
// (at least 1). The arrow
// head is two short barbs from the tip, each set back 0.25 of the arrow
// vector and offset 0.125 of it to either side (~26.6 degrees off the shaft,
// the legacy constants). Samples that are invalid or non-finite in either
// component are skipped, as are arrows shorter than 1e-6 pixels after scaling.
// There is no absolute speed cutoff; a plane with no valid nonzero vectors
// yields no segments. The output lists, per arrow, the shaft segment followed
// by its two head segments.

// Vector glyphs for the warped R-Z display of a 2-D spherical (r, theta)
// plane. The component planes are the stored fields sampled on the logical
// grid (physicalRegion gives its (r, theta) bounds): uComponent is the radial
// velocity v_r and vComponent the physical meridional velocity v_theta (both
// in length/time; AMReX spherical solvers store physical components, not the
// angular rate). Each sampled cell center is anchored at its physical position
// (R, Z) = (r sin theta, r cos theta) and its velocity is rotated into display
// components
//   V_R = v_r sin(theta) + v_theta cos(theta)
//   V_Z = v_r cos(theta) - v_theta sin(theta).
// Sampling stride, arrow-length normalization (against the maximum speed
// hypot(v_r, v_theta)), and head construction follow generateVectorGlyphs;
// the arrow scale derives from displayRegion's longest side so the on-screen
// glyph size matches the logical layouts. Arrows shorter than 1e-6 times that
// scale are skipped, independently of physical length units. Output segments
// are in display physical (R, Z) coordinates with y increasing along +Z --
// independent of the warped raster resolution, so a supersample change does
// not invalidate them.
